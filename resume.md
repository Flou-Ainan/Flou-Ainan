## Flou Ainan Oliveira
(Gabriel)

**Frontend Developer**
Flou is a Talented ans passionate Web Developer, Graphic Designer, ReactjJS Engineer, 3D modeler and Video Editor trained in Constructive Fast Learning. Very good self-tough learner with strong apetite for knowledge and understanding how things work. By understanding the Web foundations he's capable of thinking out of the box to solve problems.

Even with 1–2 years of experience in React, he's capable of delivering good code because he learned it in the right way (grasping core concepts, trying them and reinforcing learning from experience) and refactored everything learned from previous Web Dev experiences to fit the React ecosystem. Flou got 8+ years of experience with coding and 5 years of experience in web development as a part-time developer.

He believes that a good developer is someone who can understand codes by knowing what's happening under the hood, being good at refactoring and joining the variety of features and problem-solving codes together as a whole system that works in harmony. 
He thinks it's needed to have a good set of soft skills to work and communicate well with a team, and it's sometimes more valuable than having a lot of hardskills.

Being an good Developer, experienced Graphic Designer and having worked a lot with people, makes a background that fits perfect with his skill set for attending the requirements of a Frontend Developer role.
